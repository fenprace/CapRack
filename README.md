CapRack is a modular 10-inch server rack mounting system that allows you to install more equipment in your [mini rack](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack) in an aesthetic way.

A 1U in a mini rack is typically 222.25mm x 44.45mm. Many gears that people want to put in their mini rack, like mini PCs or SBCs , do not fit well in 1U. Often people would put such gears on a rack tray.

The idea of CapRack is just split 1U vertically into 2 CapRack modules, so each module can hold some gears and they are composable. Some examples:

- Put a mini PC module on one side, and a 2.5-inch disk mount module on the other side, you can make a mini NAS in 1U.
- Put a raspberry pi module on one side, and a small switch module on the other side, you get a proper network stack for your homelab.

## How to connect 2 CapRack modules

CapRack is designed to be connected with M6 screws. As M6 screws are common in server rack mounting, they are easy to access to people who have a rack.

To connect 2 CapRack modules, you need **2 M6 screws (at least 12mm long) and 2 M6 hex nuts**.
