I've built a mounting system that helps people put equipment onto their 10-inch server rack in a clean, aesthetic way.

# Background

The industrial standard of electronic equipment mounting is 19-inch.
10-inch rack is an unofficial standard that is popular among homelabbers, due to its smaller footprint.
There are not many devices on shelf that support mini rack mounting, because mini rack is a niche.
Someone just puts their devices on a tray. There are some nice solutions like https://makerworld.com/zh/models/1735856-raspberry-pi-blade-mount . But they are too dedicated to a specific device.
If you are not a big fan of raspberry pis and do not have a dozen pis to mount, you will not have the best experience.

# Solution

I've built a mounting system that helps people put equipment onto their 10-inch server rack in a clean, aesthetic way.
The idea is simple: break 1U space into 2 modules. Modules are composable. Each module can be mounted on the rack alone,
or it can be combined with another module to compose a 1U module.
